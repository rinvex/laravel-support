> **Note:** this package is just a support package for other Rinvex packages, which may not be useful on it's own, but contains some complementary generic functionality and also may not respect SemVer and break backward compatibility.


## Installation

Install via `composer require rinvex/laravel-support`


## Usage

## Support Helpers

### `intend()`

The `intend` method returns redirect response:
```php
intend([
    'route' => 'route.name.here',
    'withErrors' => ['error.message.id' => 'A custom error message'],
]);
